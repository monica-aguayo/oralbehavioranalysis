# Oral behavior analysis

This macro is developed to analyse the data extracted by Kinovea 0.8.15 for the oral processing videos of the FOP study.

It is important that the markers in Kinovea are labeled as "nose" and "chin" and that bites are labeled as "bite" and swallows as "swallow" without numbers!

Also, it is expected that the files to analyse have the following name structure:
**pp000-111.xml where 000 is the participant number and 111 is the sample code**
